This project is part of the material for the book

   Objects First with Java - A Practical Introduction using BlueJ
   Seventh edition

   Pearson Education

It is discussed in chapter 1.

The purpose of this project is to illustrate object interaction and to examine
some simple code. See chapters one and three of the book.

To use this project, create some Student objects, then create a LabClass object.
Add the students to the class using the "enrolStudent" method. Print a class
list.

Aimal's Lab Report for the V part of the first week's lab for M.Tessia'class

(part a is the question, part b is the answer)

22a.Create some Student objects. Call the getName method on each object. 
Explain what is happening.

22b. A pop up titled "BlueJ: Method Result" comes up and the following
instruction is written just below it : "Return the full name of this student."
Below that is written : "String getName()", a line of code. Even more below that
is a darker gray box where "Aimal.getName() returned:" and "String : "Aimal
Nangyalai Shah"" is written. Then besides that are two options : "Inspect" and
"Get". Upon pressing "Inspect", it displays a variety of values related to the
string such as byte value, byte coder, int hash,hashIsZero. Courtesy of Google,
I came to know what Int hash meant, I discovered that this is a hash function. 
Its use lies in pairing with hash tables to store and retrieve data items or data 
records. Ill ask you about what this is, Miss. Thank you in advance! Alongside
these  bits of data is another page relating to byte value. The first one shows
the length of said byte, 20, and there are 20 values displayed below, confirming
that this seems to be a mechanism similar to a random password generator,in my 
opinion. After that, I tried the "Get" option and was promted to enter a name for
a new object on te object bench. And so, I entered a name and surprisingly...It
did not work.

24a.Call the numberOfStudents method of that class. What does it do?

24b.It displays the number of students as "0".

31a.What are the types of the following values?

31b.
 0 : int (integer)
 “hello” : String
 101 : int (integer)
 -1 : int (integer)
 true : boolean
 “33” : return result
 3.1415 : decimal numbers
 
32a.What would you have to do to add a new field, for example one 
called name, to a circle object?

32b.Id have to code it into its class first, since fields are defined by
the class and not the object.

33a.Write the header for a method named send that has one parameter of 
type String, and does not return a value

33b.void send(String fullName)

34a.Write the header for a method named average that has two parameters, 
both of type int, and returns an int value.

34b.int average(int number1, int number2)

35a.Look at the book you are reading now. Is it an object or a class? If it is a class, name some objects.
If it is an object, name its class.

35b.Its an object since it is a specific instance of the class, book.

36a.Can an object have several classes? Discuss.

36b.No, an object cannot have several classes. Because classes can have multiple
, not the other way around. A class can invoke another class but an object only belongs
to a single class since that single class defines the object with its fields, parameters
required and methods/functions tied to said object.
