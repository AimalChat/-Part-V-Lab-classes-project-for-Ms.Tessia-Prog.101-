This project is part of the material for the book

   Objects First with Java - A Practical Introduction using BlueJ
   Seventh edition

   Pearson Education

It is discussed in chapter 1.

The purpose of this project is to illustrate object interaction and to examine
some simple code. See chapters one and three of the book.

To use this project, create some Student objects, then create a LabClass object.
Add the students to the class using the "enrolStudent" method. Print a class
list.

Aimal's Lab Report for the V part of the first week's lab for M.Tessia'class

(part a is the question, part b is the answer)

22a.Create some Student objects. Call the getName method on each object. 
Explain what is happening.

22b. A pop up titled "BlueJ: Method Result" comes up and the following
instruction is written just below it : "Return the full name of this student."
Below that is written : "String getName()", a line of code. Even more below that
is a darker gray box where "Aimal.getName() returned:" and "String : "Aimal
Nangyalai Shah"" is written. Then besides that are two options : "Inspect" and
"Get". Upon pressing "Inspect", it displays a variety of values related to the
string such as byte value, byte coder, int hash,hashIsZero. Courtesy of Google,
I came to know what Int hash meant, I discovered that this is a hash function. 
Its use lies in pairing with hash tables to store and retrieve data items or data 
records. Ill ask you about what this is, Miss. Thank you in advance! Alongside
these  bits of data is another page relating to byte value. The first one shows
the length of said byte, 20, and there are 20 values displayed below, confirming
that this seems to be a mechanism similar to a random password generator,in my 
opinion. After that, I tried the "Get" option and was promted to enter a name for
a new object on te object bench. And so, I entered a name and surprisingly...It
did not work.

24a.Call the numberOfStudents method of that class. What does it do?

24b.It displays the number of students as "0".
